THINGS I STRUGGLED WITH

1. Getting the correct font, and importing it the right way
2. Font sizing
3. Centering the main container

1. Learned how to properly import fonts using link tag in html head
2. Just had to use the actual correct font. Some margin on the text can also help with setting desired width on text block
3. Used margin: _vh auto; Alternative is to create wrapper div (essentially entire page) that takes up 100% viewport height,
then use flex display to center/align items
